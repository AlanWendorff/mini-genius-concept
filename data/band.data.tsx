      [Verse 1]
      <br />
      <br />
      I've been waiting for this shit to erupt
      <br />
      In a glass shell, been rocking back and forth for a month
      <br />
      (for a month)
      <br />I can't remember the name of a coward only the pain and the scars
      gained contour the veins, brother
      <br />I put the rank on my back
      <br />
      Let the information sink when you gaze at the facts
      <br />
      I'll be waiting for the double headed snake and the rat
      <br />I need to react and then adapt
      <br />
      Before the climax and keep intact, cuz (uh)
      <br />I keep a terror attack style like cyrax blowing up the mass, mask on
      (what)
      <br />
      I'm in a class above a black belt just like a master
      <br />
      Bow to disaster
      <br />
      Sipping blood dripping from a dagger
      <br />
      Relax like two fat hits of blue magic
      <br />
      Raised by the classics
      <br />
      First release on repeat, turn them all into addicts
      <br />
      <br />
      (Yeah, and they still ain't fucking with us)
      <br />
      <br />
      [Chorus]
      <br />
      <br />
      You can't fuck with my clique
      <br />
      Mad at the world with them scars on my fist, bitch
      <br />
      You can't fuck with my clique
      <br />
      When you're living in a state of mind you can't fix
      <br />
      You can't fuck with my clique
      <br />
      Mad at the world with them scars on my fist, bitch
      <br />
      You can't fuck with my clique
      <br />
      When you're living in a state of mind you can't fix

      [Bridge]
      <br />
      <br />
      You know I feel;
      <br />
      Charismatic the way I open my veins in the attic
      <br />
      Feeling of madness in the court of low thinking I'm in the court with a
      racquet, bringing the racket
      <br />
      Disturbing the peace, what a feat, the fraek of nature
      <br />
      Birthed my desease
      <br />
      Alert to all threats, fuck these figures I'm a hone in the skills
      <br />A clone in the hills, propose and sacrifice for the youth
      <br />
      Admitting the world except your fucking punk crew
      <br />
      <br />
      [Breakdown]
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm a break through with the clique
      <br />
      Bleeding out the motherfucking crevice in the mist
      <br />
      Surfacing the level of psychopath
      <br />
      I'm talking to a motherfucking bitch
      <br />I need to relocate the grips
      <br />
      Re arrange the cheekbonen, jow, gotta list (list)
      <br />
      Open that wound if you need another lesson from a brother like this
      <br />
      Step in line with the rest of the filth (filth)
      <br />
      <br />
      [Verse 2]
      <br />
      <br />
      Oh no, can't be controlled, step back or fold
      <br />
      The gift of rhythm; still it wasn't given to'em
      <br />
      Your better pay your respects
      <br />
      Put them hands in disposals and laugh at the mess
      <br />
      Panic or distress
      <br />
      Linear graphs predict where I rest
      <br />I digress, my minds air locked inside a chest (yo)
      <br />
      Everlasting, circumnavigating to find the action
      <br />
      Periodical visions of distractions
      <br />
      To understand the meaning of wath's happened
      <br />
      They asking, "How do we develop what you mastered?"
      <br />
      It originated in our deepest fear of falling backwards
      <br />
      And we will arise from the ashes
      <br />
      Evolded; four blacks souls the eyes matching
      <br />
      You dwelling in the past speaking latin
      <br />
      Attract the metal scene like a magnet
      <br />
      Oh please, now extract the waste that has gathered
      <br />
