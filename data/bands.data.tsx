                  I've been rocked but I've never been knocked out
                  <br />

                  Dead set you get inverted, inserted to a tripped server
                  <br />
                  Sith version, will hurt 'em

                  Click that thang and I aim perfect

                  Lane swerving and the team could perish at the main service
                  <br />

                  Check them techniques the sequence is about to leak
                  <br />
                  And decomposes the freaks who nourish us when we're weak
                  <br />
                  This shit is bleak sensei, obtain the peak then raid
                  <br />
                  Reap what you sow, or sew up your fucking teeth then pay
                  <br />
                  Because its the capital D, via strength, respect bleeds
                  <br />
                  You know we're meant to blow like IED

                  Stay flexed in a class we can’t notice
                  <br />
                  Meditating in the full lotus, holograms still patrol us
                  <br />

                  Listen; I’m falling in regret
                  <br />
                  On approach to these bed spikes I can taste the rust sever
                  through my head
                  <br />
                  But then I pause; manipulating these laws of physics
                  <br />
                  I’ve be taught; fabricate your own thought of existence
                  <br />
                  This is it
                  <br />
                  Ain't nothing out of my reach and control
                  <br />
                  I’m seizing electrical currents buried deep in your dome
                  <br />
                  Don’t let it go, hear me though
                  <br />
                  Let me know, where do I go?
                  <br />
                  Up in this area living in tyranny, look at me so far from a
                  state of from state of dispossession
                  <br />
                  Self medicated symptoms, they worsen by the second
                  <br />
                  Ain't ready for the heavens, the mind is just a weapon
                  <br />
                  Check it, be like water my friend
                  <br />
                  The system will be strict
                  <br />
                  Manoeuvre through the webs of contempt so check again
                  <br />
                  Dispensed or quarantine the depths, no respect
                  <br />
                  For the pressure I could pause what is left, check the
                  strength
                  <br />
                  Cause I was born outside these laws
                  <br />
                  Ain't no order inside my veins, or inside my walls, I pause

                  <br />
                  See it turned from a handshake then into a fight
                  <br />
                  Living life in the fast lane, that was the life
                  <br />
                  Ruthless, lawless, fuck if I die
                  <br />
                  Arrested and shot at, fiends for the night
                  <br />
                  (Ohh I don’t wanna wake up no more with a broken jaw and go to
                  court for this, bitch)
                  <br />
                  So we just grabbed the gat and put a riff and rhythm and then
                  let the vocals soar with that shit
                  <br />
                  No we on stage from the stages of blackness back to back
                  smashing bags full of hits

                  "Calibrate his skull" is what my ego says
                  <br />
                  But now I got you here bitch I’ma innovate
                  <br />
                  So elevate into that blood pact
                  <br />
                  In the heat of the combat, you'll get disarmed, meaning you
                  get your arms jacked
                  <br />
                  Your choice of elements, so we can settle how you want you
                  getting me?
                  <br />
                  In any parameter, crevice or baron moon, the result, calamity
                  <br />

                  CHORUS
                  <br />
                  So put your money where your mouth is
                  <br />
                  What you looking at, who you eyeing out, kid?
                  <br />
                  Death staring like you never seen us out here
                  <br />
                  Legendary, put your money where your mouth is
                  <br />
                  Put some respect on the name
                  <br />
                  Put some respect on the name
                  <br />

                  Come now, look at the twist in their promise and the way they
                  just lock us in fees
                  <br />
                  It ain't about the artist, its about the margin of
                  motherfucking profit seen, (Please, yeah)
                  <br />
                  Stop it, rock it, drop it

                  Lock us in contracts so they profit
                  <br />
                  Thats the strategy that they try to encourage
                  <br />
                  Let their business flourish cause “artists are rubbish” above
                  us

                  [Verse 1]
                  <br />
                  The generation built on fear, when transparency in their skin
                  will break off a tear I swear
                  <br />
                  Our sensitivity engraved and biological chemistry enrages them
                  history pages
                  <br />
                  You think it's fucking outrages
                  <br />
                  But you let 'em embrace it
                  <br />
                  The word spoken like a knife to the throat
                  <br />
                  Stick and them stones?
                  <br />
                  Fuck that words now break bones
                  <br />A text message becomes a threat and they froze, yo
                  <br />
                  It's all alarming, increase in self harming
                  <br />
                  Psychologists diagnosing everyone with a problem
                  <br />
                  “Give me the remedy in a bottle” instead of advice
                  <br />
                  It's sad to see these children crying over Instagram likes,
                  right?
                  <br />
                  Fucking pathetic, generation Y<br />
                  Children now parents, men with integrity is just a lie
                  <br />
                  The catalyst may be a lot of things
                  <br />
                  Need to accept, that shit just ain't the same
                  <br />
                  When I was a kid, yeah

                  Yo, so whats this all about?
                  <br />
                  Do we need a discussion or something about how tough you doing
                  it now?
                  <br />
                  Consulting a sulking over exaggerator
                  <br />
                  My recommendation is basic, you need to just sack it player,
                  activate em
                  <br />
                  Storm in a tea cup type shit, taking everything with a grain
                  of salt and you might slip
                  <br />
                  Trivial look at you just stressing over them small things
                  <br />
                  Better be taking 'em over to the road of recovery to sort
                  this, oh shit
                  <br />
                  Isn’t it ironic, the crying is so chronic, lying to get by in
                  its refined topic
                  <br />
                  I’m buying on it, d-d-d r-r don’t register, best if you exit
                  better have left with your testament, testing who next to ya
                  <br />
                  Mess of a situation we got now, it ain't that bad son you
                  could be gone now
                  <br />
                  Yo, 'cause everybody has got a fucking problem the issue is

                  In the trench where i pray for a disaster
                  <br />

                  They were briefed on the mission for the capture but the game
                  slipped out their hand so I grabbed it
                  <br />
                  Lactic acid filled my heart and trashed it, I'ma flirt with

                  <br />
                  Check, examining the way I fillet the skin
                  <br />
                  Making a maze and separate what encases it
                  <br />
                  Basically I can’t stop it
                  <br />
                  Mind stay hostile and toxic
                  <br />
                  Lock the thought out prepare for the rockets
                  <br />

                  I've been waiting for this shit to erupt
                  <br />
                  In a glass shell, been rocking back and forth for a month
                  <br />
                  (for a month)
                  <br />I can't remember the name of a coward only the pain and
                  the scars gained contour the veins, brother
                  <br />I put the rank on my back
                  <br />
                  Let the information sink when you gaze at the facts
                  <br />
                  I'll be waiting for the double headed snake and the rat
                  <br />I need to react and then adapt
                  <br />
                  Before the climax and keep intact, cuz (uh)
                  <br />I keep a terror attack style like cyrax blowing up the
                  mass, mask on (what)
                  <br />
                  I'm in a class above a black belt just like a master
                  <br />
                  Bow to disaster
                  <br />
                  Sipping blood dripping from a dagger
                  <br />
                  Relax like two fat hits of blue magic
                  <br />
                  Raised by the classics

                  Feeling of madness in the court of low thinking I'm in the

                  <br />
                  Disturbing the peace, what a feat, the fraek of nature

                  Linear graphs predict where I rest
                  <br />I digress, my minds air locked inside a chest (yo)
                  <br />
                  Everlasting, circumnavigating to find the action
                  <br />
                  Periodical visions of distractions
                  <br />
                  To understand the meaning of wath's happened
                  <br />
                  They asking, "How do we develop what you mastered?"
                  <br />
                  It originated in our deepest fear of falling backwards
                  <br />
                  And we will arise from the ashes
                  <br />
                  Evolded; four blacks souls the eyes matching
                  <br />
                  You dwelling in the past speaking latin
                  <br />

                  The figure that will capture the light and the breeze is the

                  Now that I can see her, we’ve fallen in love but the presence
                  is near
                  <br />
                  The more we indulge the coffin is clear
                  <br />I play with her hair but I’m ripping it out, she falls
                  in and out of consciousness what’s it about
                  <br />
                  The wicked surrounds, the signature given was killing her now,
                  the love of my life paying the price I need a way out

                  When I look in her eyes I take away her sight, thinking about
                  a kiss but that risk is too high
                  <br />
                  Tell her I love her but then her lips seal tight, sewn by the
                  devil in the night right when I kneel I feel a breeze that
                  cold feeling of liquid on my knees, in a puddle of her blood I
                  can't believe
                  <br />
                  Sickening feeling of a lie eyes deceive, seems she dissipates
                  when affections applies but the fabricated love was compressed
                  in the mind heart yelling for the love I never had in my life
                  <br />
                  On my knees in a puddle of my own blood, I can't speak my lips
                  they’ve been sewn up, unconscious now I don’t know what seems
                  I was dying the whole time I couldn’t hold her

                  All I see, In the mass of this unsound mind
                  <br />
                  Eyes emit the sign views convert to vibe
                  <br />
                  I'm just left blind, its my disease my temper directs my needs
                  I need shelter from these fantasies CAUSE I CANT BREATHE
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  How do I, shut down the brain of this set
                  <br />
                  I’ve asked with aimless intent
                  <br />
                  I’ll mend the fray that its left
                  <br />
                  But i'm afraid of the cause and effect
                  <br />
                  How do I address instinctive action I clash with rappers who
                  blabber vapid vast nasty accents, caught in the middle I need
                  a reaction
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Your broken heart, low spirit and charm
                  <br />
                  Bitter and green with envy ensuring you can't be harmed
                  <br />I smile in the face of anger the calm proceeds the storm
                  <br />
                  The paths of gods are followed while heroes banish from
                  thought x2

                  I'm breaking down, but what I found was memories looked around
                  and suddenly gained this energy and sound
                  <br />
                  Your vivid image surrounded me
                  <br />
                  Searching my past was healing me it astounded me

                  And I know it's hard reminiscing but hold the thoughts from
                  the past
                  <br />I grasp and I hold what is real, because I know that it
                  won't last
                  <br />
                  We're loving way too much lose but it happens every day so
                  what's the use
                  <br />
                  Of loving something so dearly that will be departed from you?
                  <br />I keep bumping this unhealed bruise I think I may need
                  room to move
                  <br />
                  But this room is becoming smaller like a tomb
                  <br />
                  And I'm still searching for something looking for somebody
                  that I'm loving but they're gone
                  <br />
                  Under the gravel you grab hold of your thought
                  <br />
                  Escape the claw from the reaper
                  <br />

                  <br />

                  <br />
                  Was it all but a dream, my heart sinks I detest my own speech
                  <br />I can hear the walls speaking my name they seek
                  <br />
                  Wasn’t it me speaking when I could feel two hearts at beat up
                  in the back of my brain
                  <br />
                  Caught in a trap slipping through the cracks
                  <br />
                  Need to relax caught in the act and I keep thinking about it
                  <br />
                  Pushed to the brink my knees scared and body fatigues I need
                  to fight or succumb to defeat

                  Is it a self-created myself I’m hating fuck wealth I’m aiming

                  <br />
                  Is it paid in black in depth the contract
                  <br />
                  The debt that I inherit for bringing myself back
                  <br />
                  In my eyes I see nothing but him
                  <br />
                  Is it a lie is it me or is it something within
                  <br />
                  Either way not to punk and pretend but no pity for the coward
                  who can’t cover his ends

                  <br />I know it seems dark, but sometimes you got to fight
                  with your whole heart
                  <br />
                  No matter how hard that it gets at the best you just strive to

                  As you bask in the breeze of discontent the earth vents and
                  blinds a clean sleet
                  <br />
                  In time you’ll find the weak freeze, in the past where were
                  leaving the waste we call grief cause
                  <br />I know it seems dark, but some times you got to fight
                  with your whole heart
                  <br />
                  No matter how hard that it gets at the best you just strive to

                  <br />
                  Stuck deep in a pit my brain regrets, delayed defence unstable
                  will I live?
                  <br />I can’t see, engrave the last scene I pray that my
                  thoughts seize and lay in them six feet
                  <br />
                  23 long years still I beat my thoughts ripping I’ve never
                  submitted into defeat, fear me

                  <br />I gaze in the mirror to liquefy this thesis, ideology me
                  thinking I need this
                  <br />
                  Feeling inside let me iron out the creases, trust to believe

                  Extract the pitch black demand that it falls back install the

                  <br />
                  White hot to handle, pure love demands you, blank mind like

                  In time everything heals but even time shuts down and it

                  As I’m separated away from disease
                  <br />I was medicated, decaying, I’m weak

                  Torn thinking I’m picking petals, they’re all thorns
                  <br />
                  I’ve been up and down always elevated away from a smile
                  <br />
                  Descending forever into my own frown
                  <br />

                  It’s been way too long
                  <br />
                  Putting up a fight inside that I know I can barely beat
                  <br />
                  I’ve been pushed but I’ve pulled on
                  <br />
                  All of these strings in my heart, I know that they can’t feel
                  me
                  <br />
                  Tell me why I can’t breathe
                  <br />
                  Is it all a facade, is it all my dream?
                  <br />
                  I’ve been fighting for far too long

                  leaves
                  <br />
                  Direct into a hundred thousand degrees
                  <br />
                  Skin is a repellent, internal I bleed, I concede
                  <br />
                  Walking towards my sanctuary, my ankles barely kept up with
                  the travel
                  <br />
                  That my mind is set to carry the concoction of hope and
                  pessimism it had me really worried
                  <br />
                  Had me either hoping to die or dying with hope in my heart;
                  pick a side
                  <br />
                  Look inside this barrel of empty promises to find something
                  keeping me alive
                  <br />I feel my heart reply when I decide to try
                  <br />
                  Tell me why a journey that seeks the strong sought out me but
                  failed to thrive
                  <br />

                  <br />
                  As it all unfolds, this world begins to an end but we
                  developed the mould
                  <br />
                  Like a new born soul eyes open up into a life that I just
                  don’t know
                  <br />
                  Far from alone, so far from a home we neighbour most who
                  oppose
                  <br />
                  The thought of a living with the love propelled across zones
                  <br />
                  And an end to the rise of war and burnt homes
                  <br />
                  We all breathe with the same intention, bleed but then heal
                  and they claim were different
                  <br />
                  And I got to be the one to claim hope in the bright notes but
                  I know the downward slope declines slow
                  <br />
                  So blind to the happening we can reveal the eyes behind
                  blackening
                  <br />
                  At the table of humanity gather in love and over throw the
                  cause of this tragedy
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  CHORUS:
                  <br />I fear a future shaded by our thoughtless actions, the
                  vanta-black that fills the sky reflects the madness
                  <br />
                  The earth is only young but hatred aged it faster, will we
                  close up these open wounds and make a change before we leave?
                  <br />
                  Open your heart to let it breathe
                  <br />
                  The search for love will come with peace
                  <br />
                  Our scars have surfaced can’t you see? They’ve shown who we
                  were but that can change we must believe
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  BRIDGE:
                  <br />
                  Have we all had enough, looking for a way out with the world
                  in a rut
                  <br />
                  Looking down some are looking up above
                  <br />
                  When the reason is in front to be solved
                  <br />
                  But I know, it is not but a phase
                  <br />
                  Just part from the ways, the ways of the un natural thought
                  break from the chain
                  <br />
                  Till we reconnect then we can all make change
                  <br />
                  Cause I’ve been looking for the reason why we cycle our past
                  with the hate but I’ve given up
                  <br />
                  Sitting up and I’ve been thinking about it, if we could
                  refresh our past would the bitterness simmer up?
                  <br />
                  Is it ever gonna get any better and then I wonder would it
                  ever be the same if we never had no purpose to gain
                  <br />
                  Kill off the thought and the purpose to hate and search for
                  the change
                  <br />
                  And it might seem tough but the diamond in rough won’t fade
                  <br />
                  We can’t wait to long we gotta push enough to make change
                  <br />
                  Take a step in the dark put a rest to the bark and the blade
                  <br />
                  Just open your chest invest into your heart, the rest will
                  find us all calm in the shade so don’t be afraid
                  <br />

                  <br />
                  They rest the ones who inject the dark that made us believe we

                  The invented the boarded land then withdrew the touch of your

                  But we evolve with economy to slaughter man so we can reclaim

                  Can we all take a chance, hold out your hand believe and just

                  <br />
                  <br />I can't believe this
                  <br />
                  You will flee when the breeze hits
                  <br />
                  Down for the fellas, nah you're down on you're knees bitch
                  <br />I dissolve them synthetic soldiers
                  <br />
                  Forcing them acidic bullets into your soul ah
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  (VERSE)
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  DESTRUCT THE INDESTRUCTIBLE
                  <br />
                  Straight to the depths is where i'ma send them
                  <br />
                  Shatter their dreams and cough up the resin
                  <br />
                  Destruct and breach like a mother fucking henchmen
                  <br />
                  Now you can't breathe you realize your empty
                  <br />I need you to tell me
                  <br />
                  What is that you're looking at
                  <br />
                  When you're looking in the mirror
                  <br />
                  Now is it clearer
                  <br />
                  It's vague right now
                  <br />
                  But the visual nears ya
                  <br />
                  You are no hero
                  <br />
                  SO TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT
                  <br />
                  Do you wanna be noticed, Do you wanna be focused on?
                  <br />
                  TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT
                  <br />I know you're looking for attention but you're giving
                  the impression that you're desperate
                  <br />
                  TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT
                  <br />
                  Are you sick of yourself now, does it rip through the seams?
                  <br />
                  TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT
                  <br />
                  You're sick of yourself i can see it inject the vaccine
                  <br />I can hardly see it
                  <br />
                  My eyes roll back and i find it hard to seek it
                  <br />
                  So i believe it is the ego speaking
                  <br />I feel my alter ego breaching my brain and i can't
                  control it
                  <br />
                  Heal them all with the pain
                  <br />I was taught by
                  <br />
                  The mother fucking voice in the back of my head
                  <br />
                  Lacerate and invalidate them them

                  The truth from your lies
                  <br />

                  That man that he wanted to be and
                  <br />
                  That man ain't nothing to me
                  <br />
                  Because i, could read him from a distance
                  <br />
                  Suddenly tapping into a sixth sense
                  <br />
                  Overtaken on the internals domestic
                  <br />
                  But to be honest i really love it
                  <br />
                  The feeling is over coming
                  <br />
                  Demolish em with the knowledge can i risk it?
                  <br />I should just ditch that!

                  Picking up on the patterns I’m just here to relax and you know

                  My backs up against the wall, you’ve pushed to far forcing it
                  down my core, what’s about to explore is all this anger that I
                  have stored I feel rejection, my anger projecting towards
                  they’re motherfucking head leaving a fat fist full of
                  impressions, they want to act up so I react with a vengeance

                  bust skin and bruise eyes
                  <br />I need you to throw another death stare that aggression
                  I’ve never feared, underestimated like cheating death you’ll
                  never make it so beware
                  <br />
                  You’re pushing me close to the edge so just beware, the straps
                  on this straight jacket are disconnecting I can see the fear
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In those motherfucking eyes and its clear I’ve been giving
                  them a lot to talk about but their mouth gets shut when I hit
                  them with a fist, underground gain sound when you hear me spit
                  <br />
                  Scars represent regret, memories you can forget stained by the
                  circle of beast the C.O.B is too legit

                  Bringing on the fucking sickness vaccinated by the fist of the
                  viscous, malnutrition mass murderer skin itching bitches when
                  it comes to brawling, million dollar baby I feel I’m boxing
                  with a lady, hands striking unnoticed, losing focus
                  unconscious but awakened to smell the roses, how can you? Your
