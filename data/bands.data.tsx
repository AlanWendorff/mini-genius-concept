                  Dead set you get inverted, inserted to a tripped server
                  <br />
                  Sith version, will hurt &lsquo;em

                  Lane swerving and the team could perish at the main service

                  Listen; I&apos;m falling in regret
                  <br />
                  On approach to these bed spikes I can taste the rust sever
                  through my head
                  <br />
                  But then I pause; manipulating these laws of physics
                  <br />
                  I&apos;ve be taught; fabricate your own thought of existence
                  <br />
                  This is it
                  <br />
                  Ain&lsquo;t nothing out of my reach and control
                  <br />
                  I&apos;m seizing electrical currents buried deep in your dome
                  <br />
                  Don&apos;t let it go, hear me though
                  <br />
                  Let me know, where do I go?
                  <br />
                  Up in this area living in tyranny, look at me so far from a
                  state of from state of dispossession
                  <br />
                  Self medicated symptoms, they worsen by the second
                  <br />
                  Ain&lsquo;t ready for the heavens, the mind is just a weapon
                  <br />
                  Check it, be like water my friend
                  <br />
                  The system will be strict
                  <br />
                  Manoeuvre through the webs of contempt so check again
                  <br />
                  Dispensed or quarantine the depths, no respect
                  <br />
                  For the pressure I could pause what is left, check the
                  strength
                  <br />
                  Cause I was born outside these laws
                  <br />
                  Ain&lsquo;t no order inside my veins, or inside my walls, I

                  Still looking for the petty little proof
                  <br />
                  Still blacking out with my lads from the bamboo
                  <br />
                  Still coming for the heads of you snitches in the booth (woo!)

                  Come now, look at the twist in their promise and the way they
                  just lock us in fees
                  <br />
                  It ain&lsquo;t about the artist, its about the margin of

                  Stop it, rock it, drop it

                  [Verse 1]
                  <br />
                  The generation built on fear, when transparency in their skin
                  will break off a tear I swear
                  <br />
                  Our sensitivity engraved and biological chemistry enrages them
                  history pages
                  <br />
                  You think it&lsquo;s fucking outrages
                  <br />
                  But you let &lsquo;em embrace it
                  <br />
                  The word spoken like a knife to the throat
                  <br />
                  Stick and them stones?
                  <br />
                  Fuck that words now break bones
                  <br />A text message becomes a threat and they froze, yo
                  <br />
                  It&lsquo;s all alarming, increase in self harming
                  <br />
                  Psychologists diagnosing everyone with a problem
                  <br />
                  “Give me the remedy in a bottle” instead of advice
                  <br />
                  It&lsquo;s sad to see these children crying over Instagram
                  likes, right?
                  <br />
                  Fucking pathetic, generation Y<br />
                  Children now parents, men with integrity is just a lie
                  <br />
                  The catalyst may be a lot of things
                  <br />
                  Need to accept, that shit just ain&lsquo;t the same

                  Yo, so whats this all about?
                  <br />
                  Do we need a discussion or something about how tough you doing
                  it now?
                  <br />
                  Consulting a sulking over exaggerator
                  <br />
                  My recommendation is basic, you need to just sack it player,
                  activate em
                  <br />
                  Storm in a tea cup type shit, taking everything with a grain
                  of salt and you might slip
                  <br />
                  Trivial look at you just stressing over them small things
                  <br />
                  Better be taking &lsquo;em over to the road of recovery to
                  sort this, oh shit
                  <br />
                  Isn&apos;t it ironic, the crying is so chronic, lying to get
                  by in its refined topic
                  <br />
                  I&apos;m buying on it, d-d-d r-r don&apos;t register, best if
                  you exit better have left with your testament, testing who
                  next to ya
                  <br />
                  Mess of a situation we got now, it ain&lsquo;t that bad son
                  you could be gone now
                  <br />
                  Yo, &lsquo;cause everybody has got a fucking problem the issue

                  <br />
                  Disturbing the peace, what a feat, the fraek of nature
                  <br />
                  Birthed my desease
                  <br />

                  the skills
                  <br />A clone in the hills, propose and sacrifice for the
                  youth
                  <br />
                  Admitting the world except your fucking punk crew

                  Bleeding out the motherfucking crevice in the mist
                  <br />
                  Surfacing the level of psychopath
                  <br />
                  I&lsquo;m talking to a motherfucking bitch
                  <br />I need to relocate the grips

                  Re arrange the cheekbonen, jow, gotta list (list)
                  <br />
                  Open that wound if you need another lesson from a brother like
                  this
                  <br />
                  Step in line with the rest of the filth (filth)

                  Oh no, can&lsquo;t be controlled, step back or fold
                  <br />
                  The gift of rhythm; still it wasn&lsquo;t given to&lsquo;em

                  <br />
                  Put them hands in disposals and laugh at the mess
                  <br />
                  Panic or distress
                  <br />
                  Linear graphs predict where I rest
                  <br />I digress, my minds air locked inside a chest (yo)
                  <br />
                  Everlasting, circumnavigating to find the action
                  <br />
                  Periodical visions of distractions
                  <br />
                  To understand the meaning of wath&lsquo;s happened
                  <br />
                  They asking, "How do we develop what you mastered?"
                  <br />
                  It originated in our deepest fear of falling backwards
                  <br />
                  And we will arise from the ashes
                  <br />
                  Evolded; four blacks souls the eyes matching
                  <br />
                  You dwelling in the past speaking latin
                  <br />
                  Attract the metal scene like a magnet
                  <br />
                  Oh please, now extract the waste that has gathered

                  The figure that will capture the light and the breeze is the

                  The more we indulge the coffin is clear
                  <br />I play with her hair but I&apos;m ripping it out, she

                  <br />
                  The wicked surrounds, the signature given was killing her now,

                  When I look in her eyes I take away her sight, thinking about
                  a kiss but that risk is too high
                  <br />
                  Tell her I love her but then her lips seal tight, sewn by the
                  devil in the night right when I kneel I feel a breeze that
                  cold feeling of liquid on my knees, in a puddle of her blood I
                  can&lsquo;t believe
                  <br />
                  Sickening feeling of a lie eyes deceive, seems she dissipates
                  when affections applies but the fabricated love was compressed
                  in the mind heart yelling for the love I never had in my life
                  <br />
                  On my knees in a puddle of my own blood, I can&lsquo;t speak
                  my lips they&apos;ve been sewn up, unconscious now I

                  But it won&apos;t stop till I break the ice in this bitch
                  <br />
                  Looking down from the top you envy my clique
                  <br />
                  Get stomped with a Doc to the back of the head and after that
                  rewind the beef never ends
                  <br />
                  Sick trend, fuck what the scene is
                  <br />
                  Full of hate no love for achievers
                  <br />
                  In a basement behind their keyboards
                  <br />
                  Disgrace to the scene more than we are
                  <br />
                  Duck taped up
                  <br />
                  Put your body on the floor what the fuck they want?
                  <br />
                  Lock jaw like a pitty but I&apos;m not chained up
                  <br />
                  Put your face to the floor and your back faced up
                  <br />
                  Face fate, spine to the future
                  <br />
                  Laugh to the sky bring a storm with the humour
                  <br />
                  Disturbed my thoughts are just luna tic toc times up run
                  through them

                  How do I address instinctive action I clash with rappers who
                  blabber vapid vast nasty accents, caught in the middle I need

                  <br />

                  Bitter and green with envy ensuring you can&lsquo;t be harmed

                  around and suddenly gained this energy and sound
                  <br />
                  Your vivid image surrounded me
                  <br />
                  Searching my past was healing me it astounded me

                  from the past
                  <br />I grasp and I hold what is real, because I know that it
                  won&lsquo;t last
                  <br />
                  We&lsquo;re loving way too much lose but it happens every day

                  <br />
                  Of loving something so dearly that will be departed from you?
                  <br />I keep bumping this unhealed bruise I think I may need
                  room to move
                  <br />
                  But this room is becoming smaller like a tomb

                  And I&lsquo;m still searching for something looking for
                  somebody that I&lsquo;m loving but they&lsquo;re gone

                  Under the gravel you grab hold of your thought

                  <br />
                  I&lsquo;m breaking down, but what I found was memories looked
                  around and suddenly gained this energy
                  <br />
                  Your sound and vivid image surrounded me
                  <br />
                  Searching my past was healing me it astounded me

                  Was it all but a dream, my heart sinks I detest my own speech
                  <br />I can hear the walls speaking my name they seek
                  <br />
                  Wasn&apos;t it me speaking when I could feel two hearts at
                  beat up in the back of my brain
                  <br />
                  Caught in a trap slipping through the cracks
                  <br />
                  Need to relax caught in the act and I keep thinking about it
                  <br />
                  Pushed to the brink my knees scared and body fatigues I need
                  to fight or succumb to defeat
                  <br />
                  Is it a self-created myself I&apos;m hating fuck wealth
                  I&apos;m aiming to cure my health in lamens
                  <br />
                  Is it paid in black in depth the contract
                  <br />
                  The debt that I inherit for bringing myself back
                  <br />
                  In my eyes I see nothing but him
                  <br />
                  Is it a lie is it me or is it something within
                  <br />
                  Either way not to punk and pretend but no pity for the coward
                  who can&apos;t cover his ends

                  Stuck deep in a pit my brain regrets, delayed defence unstable

                  <br />I gaze in the mirror to liquefy this thesis, ideology me

                  Feeling inside let me iron out the creases, trust to believe

                  <br />
                  White hot to handle, pure love demands you, blank mind like

                  Tell me why I can&apos;t breathe

                  Is it all a facade, is it all my dream?

                  Direct into a hundred thousand degrees

                  Skin is a repellent, internal I bleed, I concede

                  That my mind is set to carry the concoction of hope and
                  pessimism it had me really worried

                  Had me either hoping to die or dying with hope in my heart;
                  pick a side
                  <br />
                  Look inside this barrel of empty promises to find something
                  keeping me alive
                  <br />I feel my heart reply when I decide to try
                  <br />
                  Tell me why a journey that seeks the strong sought out me but
                  failed to thrive

                  As it all unfolds, this world begins to an end but we
                  developed the mould
                  <br />
                  Like a new born soul eyes open up into a life that I just
                  don&apos;t know
                  <br />
                  Far from alone, so far from a home we neighbour most who
                  oppose
                  <br />
                  The thought of a living with the love propelled across zones
                  <br />
                  And an end to the rise of war and burnt homes
                  <br />
                  We all breathe with the same intention, bleed but then heal
                  and they claim were different
                  <br />
                  And I got to be the one to claim hope in the bright notes but
                  I know the downward slope declines slow
                  <br />
                  So blind to the happening we can reveal the eyes behind
                  blackening
                  <br />
                  At the table of humanity gather in love and over throw the
                  cause of this tragedy

                  <br />I fear a future shaded by our thoughtless actions, the
                  vanta-black that fills the sky reflects the madness
                  <br />
                  The earth is only young but hatred aged it faster, will we
                  close up these open wounds and make a change before we leave?
                  <br />
                  Open your heart to let it breathe
                  <br />
                  The search for love will come with peace
                  <br />
                  Our scars have surfaced can&apos;t you see? They&apos;ve shown
                  who we were but that can change we must believe

                  Have we all had enough, looking for a way out with the world
                  in a rut
                  <br />
                  Looking down some are looking up above
                  <br />
                  When the reason is in front to be solved
                  <br />
                  But I know, it is not but a phase
                  <br />
                  Just part from the ways, the ways of the un natural thought
                  break from the chain
                  <br />
                  Till we reconnect then we can all make change
                  <br />
                  Cause I&apos;ve been looking for the reason why we cycle our
                  past with the hate but I&apos;ve given up
                  <br />
                  Sitting up and I&apos;ve been thinking about it, if we could
                  refresh our past would the bitterness simmer up?
                  <br />
                  Is it ever gonna get any better and then I wonder would it
                  ever be the same if we never had no purpose to gain
                  <br />
                  Kill off the thought and the purpose to hate and search for
                  the change
                  <br />
                  And it might seem tough but the diamond in rough won&apos;t
                  fade
                  <br />
                  We can&apos;t wait to long we gotta push enough to make change
                  <br />
                  Take a step in the dark put a rest to the bark and the blade
                  <br />
                  Just open your chest invest into your heart, the rest will
                  find us all calm in the shade so don&apos;t be afraid

                  Shatter their dreams and cough up the resin

                  Destruct and breach like a mother fucking henchmen

                  <br />
                  When you&lsquo;re looking in the mirror
                  <br />
                  Now is it clearer
                  <br />
                  It&lsquo;s vague right now
                  <br />
                  But the visual nears ya
                  <br />
                  You are no hero
                  <br />
                  SO TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT
                  <br />
                  Do you wanna be noticed, Do you wanna be focused on?
                  <br />
                  TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT

                  you&lsquo;re giving the impression that you&lsquo;re desperate

                  My eyes roll back and i find it hard to seek it
                  <br />
                  So i believe it is the ego speaking
                  <br />I feel my alter ego breaching my brain and i can&lsquo;t
                  control it
